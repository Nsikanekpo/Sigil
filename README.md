Sigil making in Ancient times was believed to posses magical powers that could bring fortune to the maker, where the practitioner writes down his/her intents or wish on a piece
of paper, removes all vowel sounds from the writing including repetitive letters, draws a symbol using what letters are left to create the sigil, to be burnt, destroyed or stored
away safely to activate its powers!
 However, this project is not meant to create Magic *smiles* but to demonstrate python's capability of creating a program from this abstarct idea using Object Oriented programming
 paradigms to remove vowels, repetitive letters and even punctuations from a users inputed sentence to create the perfect sigil. Run_it and feel the Magic!
